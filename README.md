Hey, I’m Juan — Welcome to My GitHub!

I’m a builder, a breaker, and a lifelong student of the digital world.  
This is where I share my experiments, projects, and late-night obsessions — from flying FPV drones to digging deep into cybersecurity and tech that challenges how we think.

### What You'll Find Here

- **FPV Drones** – custom 3D-printed parts, flight tuning, logs, and DIY rigs  
- **Cybersecurity Projects** – red team labs, scripts, exploits, and defenses  
- **Tinkering with Tech** – Raspberry Pi NAS builds, automation, and homelab setups  
- **Learning by Doing** – small tools, writeups, challenges, and random breakthroughs

### Why I’m Doing This

I believe in learning by building — and sometimes breaking — things.  
This GitHub is my digital lab journal. It's raw, real, and always evolving.

### In the Works

- Building a red vs blue cybersecurity lab from scratch (Raspberry Pi + VMs)  
- Designing modular drone frames and printable gear for freestyle flying  
- Writing walkthroughs for hands-on security challenges and homegrown CTFs  
- Experimenting with AI and anomaly detection for network defense
