# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi, I'm **Juan** — a curious builder, lifelong learner, and tech tinkerer.  
Here you'll find a mix of my personal projects that span across:

- 🛸 **FPV drones** – builds, 3D prints, firmware tuning, and flight logs  
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity** – red vs blue labs, tools, scripts, and writeups  
- 💻 **Coding & Automation** – from bash one-liners to Python utilities  
- 📦 **Homelab & DIY Tech** – Raspberry Pi projects, NAS setups, and more

I use this space to:
- Document what I’m learning
- Share tools and resources
- Break stuff, fix it, and learn from the process
